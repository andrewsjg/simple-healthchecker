# AI Assisted Coding Experiment - Comparing Claude Code and GitHub CoPilot agents

## Simple Healthchecker

This repository contains the code for a simple healthchecker application implemented twice. Once with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/solutions/coding) using the Sonnet 4.5 model and once with the help of [GitHub CoPilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/) using gpt-5 model. 

The healthchecker is a simple [Go](https://go/dev) app that lets you configure uptime checks using ping or an HTTP check and can report status to [healthchecks.io](https://healthcheck.io) for simple alert routing. It is intended to have some utility while being quite simplistic.

## AI Assisted Coding

The real purpose of this project is to compare the practicality, usability and state of AI coding agents to produce a useable application. 

My intention is to add [gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/) into the mix at some point in the future.
